# Wi-Fi Manager Service 
This background service was designed for home linux-based headless servers connected to the local network over Wi-Fi and it allows to avoid a hassle with resetting Wi-Fi if somewhing was changed. Just connect to the automatically raised hotspot and send new network SSID and password with a simple web interface.
### How it works 
The service monitors Wi-Fi connection status with `nmcli` and if there is no active one, it stops `NetworkManager` service, manually sets static IP for wlan interface using `ifconfig`, starts `isc-dhcp-server` and finally starts `hostapd`.
### What if my WiFi recovers back?
Even being in hotspot mode, service periodically swithes back to the NetworkManager controlled state and rescans networks. If any known Wi-Fi is found, it will reconnect to it. Be aware that periodic recheck is disabled if someone is connected to the hotspot.

## Features 
 
- Monitor available Wi-Fi networks using `nmcli`.

- Automatic switch to hotspot mode when there is no known Wi-FI network and periodic rescan and reconnect attempt if any is available again.

- Simple web page to see the current status and reconnect to another Wi-Fi network
 
- REST API to: 
  - Get available networks (`GET /wifi/available`).
  - Get actual connection status (`GET /wifi/status`)
  - Force rescan (`POST /wifi/rescan`).
  - Connect to the specified network (`POST /wifi/connect`).

## Requirements 
 
1. **Python**  (Python 3.x recommended)
 
2. **nmcli**  (part of `NetworkManager` for managing Wi-Fi)
 
3. **systemd**  (for service management)
 
4. **isc-dhcp-server**  (for DHCP in hotspot mode)
 
5. **hostapd**  (for creating a Wi-Fi hotspot)

Service doesn't provide any automatic configuration of the dependencies. You should set up dhcp and hostapd configuration manually before using it. There are configs examples below.

## Set up guide

### 1. Clone the Repository 

Clone the repository to your desired directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:igem0n/wifi-manager.git
cd wifi-manager
```

### 2. Wi-Fi manager configuration 
Create a config file for our service to let it know which network device it should use, which ip address will be used for hotspot dhcp and which port listen for API and webpage. 

- Create new  directory `/etc/wifi-manager/` and config file `wifi-manager.conf` in it:

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/wifi-manager
sudo nano /etc/wifi-manager/wifi-manager.conf
```

- Paste the following configuration into the file replacing values with yours:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
interface=wlan0
gateway=192.168.10.1
port=5000
```

### 3. Install dependencies 

Install necessary dependencies using the following commands:


```bash
# Install Python 3 and pip if not installed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip libsystemd-dev

# Install NetworkManager (nmcli), isc-dhcp-server, and hostapd
sudo apt install network-manager isc-dhcp-server hostapd

# Install required Python packages
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### !!! Important !!!
Disable all the hotspot related services, they could brake NetworkManager functioning:
```bash
sudo systemctl disable hostapd.service
sudo systemctl disable isc-dhcp-server.service
```

### 4. Set Up the Systemd Service 
Create a `systemd` service unit file to manage the Wi-Fi manager service. 
- Create a new `wifi-manager.service` file in `/etc/systemd/system/`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/wifi-manager.service
```
 
- Paste the following configuration into the file:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=WiFi Monitoring Service
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/orangepi/wifi_manager
ExecStart=/home/orangepi/wifi_manager/.venv/bin/gunicorn -c wifi_manager_conf.py app:app
KillMode=control-group
KillSignal=SIGTERM
TimeoutStopSec=10
User=root
Group=root
Environment="PATH=/home/orangepi/wifi_manager/.venv/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin"
Environment="PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
**Note** : Replace `/home/orangepi/wifi_manager` with the actual path where your cloned this repo.
 
- Reload the `systemd` configuration to recognize the new service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
 
### 5. Hostapd service configuration

Configure `hostapd` to create a Wi-Fi access point:
- Edit the `/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf` file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
```

Example configuration, **interface should be set identical with our Wi-Fi manager service config, also set you own SSID and passphrase there**:


```ini
interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
country_code=XX
hw_mode=g
channel=7
ssid=MyAccessPoint
wpa=2
auth_algs=1
wpa_passphrase=12345678
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
wpa_pairwise=CCMP
wmm_enabled=1
ctrl_interface=/var/run/hostapd
ctrl_interface_group=0
```
- Update `/etc/default/hostapd` to point to the config file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd
```

- Add or modify this line:

```ini
DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"
```
 
### 6. DHCP service configuration 
Configure `isc-dhcp-server` to assign IP addresses in hotspot mode.
- Edit the `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
```

Example configuration, **router ip should be set identical with our wifi service config**:

```ini
authoritative;
subnet 192.168.10.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        range 192.168.10.10 192.168.10.50;
        option broadcast-address 192.168.10.255;
        option routers 192.168.10.1;
        default-lease-time 600;
        max-lease-time 7200;
        option domain-name "local";
        option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;
}
```
- Edit the `/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server` to specify the interface:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
```
- Set the `INTERFACES` variable, **it should be set identical with our wifi service config**:

```ini
INTERFACESv4="wlan0"
INTERFACESv6=""
```

### 7. Manually check the set up
Run the following commands to make sure that hotspot runs correctly and NetworkManager is able to reconnect after being restarted.

- List Wi-Fi networks, make sure you see your usual Wi-Fi's there:

```bash
sudo nmcli -t -f SSID,Signal dev wifi list --rescan yes
```

- Check active connection, one of them the should be your Wi-Fi name:

```bash
sudo nmcli -t -f NAME,DEVICE con show --active
```

- Switch to the hotspot mode, you should be able to connect to the hotspot and access all the services running on your server via IP previously set as a router:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
sudo ifconfig wlan0 192.168.10.1
sudo systemctl start isc-dhcp-server.service
sudo systemctl start hostapd.service
```

- List active hotpot connections, you should see MAC-address-like entries for each of the connected device:
```bash
sudo hostapd_cli list_sta
```

- Switch back to the normal Wi-Fi mode, network manager should reconnect to your home Wi-Fi as usual:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop hostapd.service
sudo systemctl stop isc-dhcp-server.service
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager.service
```

### 8. Run and test Wi-Fi manager service
If previous steps worked, try to run our service and test if it's functioning using API and compare results to commands output from previous step.

- Start service:
```bash
sudo systemctl start wifi-manager.service
```

- Check status, it should be running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status wifi-manager.service
```

- Check systemd journal, there shouldn't be any exceptions or errros:
```bash
journalctl -u wifi-manager.service -f
```

- Test endpoints listed above, for the `connect` command you should pass JSON object in the request body with `ssid` and `password` fields:
```json
{
  "ssid": "ssid",
  "password": "password"
}
```

- If everything is working, you can set the serive for automatic start whith the system:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable wifi-manager.service
```
